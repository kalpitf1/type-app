A typing test app, built with the MERN stack (MongoDB Express React Node), that measures the time taken by the user to type the English alphabets. React handles the frontend to display the app components for the user input and display the leaderboard, Express and Node handle the backend to make AJAX calls to the create and read data from the database in MongoDB.
